Some of these scripts are accessed using the `__init__.py` generated by SCRAM. 
If you run into problems with scripts that import a package/script from this directory, you can try to generate the init by doing a simple `scram b`.

# Workflow
1. first create flat trees that are skimmed using some pre-selection. See [JetMass/README.md](../README.md) for details.
2. fill 3D maps that are needed for DDT maps. You can use the coffea processor
   1. create 2D percentile maps for each DDT tagger for each year using `build_ddt_map.py`
3. fill templates using the coffea processor `JetMassTemplateProcessor.py`
   1. adjust path to ddt-maps if necessary (e.g. see `self._n2ddtmaps`)
   2. adjust other pre-compiled data (i.e. trigger-sf, k-factors) if needed.
4. flatten output from coffea processor into 1d ROOT (and coffea) hists.
   1. `./flatten_templates.sh` and `./flatten_templates.sh _particlenet`
   2. create control plots
      1. `flatten_control_plots.sh` to create ROOT files with hists from coffea processor
      2. `python hadd_control_plots --preselection --output UHH_controlplots_presel` (before this make sure you hadded the output files from UHH2)
      3. finally `./data_mc_plots.sh` to make plots
5. templates are ready to be used by ralph (see [JetMass/rhalp/README.md](../rhalph/README.md) for details)
